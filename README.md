# Nexys4DDR-audio
Synthesize audio record and playback hardware on a Nexys 4 DDR board.

All source and sim files are included in this repo.  However, the bitstream has already been generated; one can simply push this to the FPGA.

Headphones/speaker with a 3.5 mm recording and playback capability are required.
